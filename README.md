# Huckel_Triangulenes
Hückel Hamiltonian for Triangulenes and Hexagonal Graphene Nanoislands

This is a program written in python which main objective is to describe the Hückel Hamiltonian in Triangulenes. Each triangulene is constructed with hexagons and their coordinates are applied to describe the position of each atom. The program will ask for the number of hexagons per side to construct automatically the triangulene and later one can take away tips from the triangulene.
These tips are going to be shaped into small triangules, commonly called hexagonal graphene nanoislands.

At the end of the code, one can visualize the constructed triangulene using the coordinates system.


Have fun!
